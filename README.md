- The first user that enters a given room is considered a Mentor, the second user is the Student and afterwards each additional student is a Watcher.
- Student can read, write and submit the code.

- Watcher can only read.

- For testing the submission button solutions for the tasks can be found in @lib/services/solutions.js
